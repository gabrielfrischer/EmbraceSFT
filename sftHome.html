        <li><b>procedure: </b>         Place the chair  against a wall, or otherwise stabilize it for safety. The subject sits in the middle of the seat, with their feet shoulder width apart, flat on the floor. The arms are to be crossed at the wrists and held  close to the chest. From the sitting position, the subject stands completely up, then completely back down, and this is repeated for 30 seconds. Count the total number of complete chair stands  (up and down equals one stand).

 <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li><b>purpose: </b>This test measures upper body strength and endurance.</li>
        <li><b>equipment required: </b>4 pound weight (women, AAHPERD), 5 pound weight (women, SFT),  8 pound weight (for men). A chair without armrests, stopwatch</li>
        <li><b>procedure: </b>The aim of this test is to do as many arm curls as possible in 30 seconds. This test is conducted on the dominant arm side (or ber side). The subject sits on the chair, holding the weight in the  hand using a suitcase grip (palm facing towards the body) with the arm in a vertically down position beside the chair. Brace the upper arm against the body so that only the lower arm is moving (tester may assist to hold the upper arm steady). Curl the arm up through a full range of motion, gradually turning the palm up (flexion with supination). As the arm is lowered through the full range of motion, gradually return to the starting position. The arm must be fully bent and then fully straightened at the elbow. The protocol for the AAHPERD test describes the administrator's hand being placed on the biceps, and the lower arm must touch the tester's hand for a full bicep curl to be counted. Repeat this action as many times as possible within 30 seconds.</li>

        <li><b>equipment required: </b>ruler, straight back or folding chair,  (about 17 inches/44 cm high)</li>
        <li><b>procedure: </b> The subject sits on the edge a chair (placed against a wall for safety). One foot must remain flat on the floor. The other leg is extended forward with the knee straight, heel on the floor, and ankle bent at 90Â°. Place one hand on top of the other with tips of the middle fingers even. Instruct the subject to Inhale, and then as they exhale, reach forward toward the toes by bending at the hip. Keep the back straight and head up. Avoid bouncing or quick movements, and never stretch to the point of pain. Keep the knee straight, and hold the reach for 2 seconds. The distance is measured between the tip of the fingertips and the toes. If the fingertips touch the toes then the score is zero. If they do not touch, measure the distance between the fingers and the toes (a negative score), if they overlap, measure by how much (a positive score). Perform two trials.

Place one hand behind the head and back over the shoulder, and reach as far as possible down the middle of your back, your palm touching your body and the fingers directed downwards. Place the other arm behind your back, palm facing outward and fingers upward and reach up as far as possible attempting to touch or overlap the middle fingers of both hands. An assistant is required to direct the subject so that the fingers are aligned, and to measure the distance between the tips of the middle fingers. If the fingertips touch then the score is zero. If they do not touch, measure the distance between the finger tips (a negative score), if they overlap, measure by how much (a positive score). Practice two times, and then test two times.
